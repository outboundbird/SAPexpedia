The proteomic data should be provided to biomarker statistical analysis team in Normalized Protein Expression (NPX) values. For each sample and each essay, the observations with QC flag will be examined. Low quality samples or assays will be considered to be removed from the analysis.  For each assay, the limit of detection (LOD) will be provided. The distribution of values under the LOD and other missing values will be inspected. If needed, the missing data not due to the LOD will be investigated and the values will be estimated with appropriate imputation methods. An MDS or PCA plot will assess the quality of the data, including identifying potential outliers and batch effects. The possible batch effects may be considered in the statistical analysis.
