# General considerations
In general, unless otherwise specified, continuous data will be summarized using the number of observations available, mean, Standard Deviation (SD), median, [Q1, Q3,] minimum, and maximum. Categorical and ordinal data will be summarized using the count and percentage of participants, as appropriate.
The baseline value is defined as [the last available value before the first dose of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) [for each study period for crossover.] For participants [randomized/enrolled] but not treated, the baseline value is defined as the last available value before [randomization/enrollment]].
Unless otherwise specified, analyses will be performed [by intervention group (and overall, for baseline and demographics characteristics)].
