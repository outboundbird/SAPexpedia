## Genotyping

Genotyping will be carried out by Labcorp Drug Development. The PharmacoScan™assay will be used to estimate the genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions, copy number variants) and haplotypes in the DMET™platformgenes.The platform covers about 3047genetic variants across HLAgenes,content from the DMETplatform, Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC®), and approximately 18000DMET markers in approximately 3900genes,including CYPs, drugtransporters,and known genes associated with DILI (eg, PTPN22).Of these markers currently available on the platform, 20 markers are identified as being associated with DILIbased on literature.

Labcorp Drug Development will provide the genotypes for each variant in the selected participants. SNPswill be encoded with the number of minor alleles.

## Quality control

Quality control for genotyping data will be examined by sample and bymarker.

### Quality controlper biological sample

The followingwill be examined:
 - A genotype call rate <90% indicatespoor samplequality, therefore calling results are unreliable and should be removed.
 - Heterozygosity abnormality (inbreeding coefficient):ahigh heterozygosityrateindicatessample contaminations.
 - Relatedness (IBD):participantsshould be unrelated with anIBD valueapproaching0.
 - Sex check:Check if the recorded sex is consistent with the biological sex.

### Quality control per marker

Per marker QC will be performed after biological QC (after removal of poor quality samples).
The following aspectswill be examined for a given marker:

 - Missing rate: Markerswitha missing rate>1%should beremoved or at least flagged. Markers with amissing rate >5%, should not be consideredin the analysis,becausethisindicatesprobe malfunction.
 - Minor allele frequency <5% should be flagged because the analysis will be underpowered.
 - Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE):Markers in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium will be flagged butnot removed.

### Other considerations

The following will also be examined:

 - Population stratification/ancestry information: examinethe ancestry informationin the study populationto avoid spurious associations.
