Exome sequencing is applied to identify, at high resolution,genetic variationin the HLA region.

## Targeted genes

A long-range sequencing approach will be performed: ForClass I HLA loci, exons 1 through 8will be sequenced;for Class II HLA loci,exons 1through 6will be sequencedwith the exception of DRB4whereexons 2 and3will be sequenced.These exons include the peptide-antigen binding region.The following genes are to be targeted:Class I HLA genes A, B,and C;Class II genes DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1,and DPB1.The sequencing data in theHLA region will be generated by LabCorp.

## Quality control

The QC of exonsequencing requires access toraw data. Labcorp willprovide the QC report covering the following aspects:

 - depthof coverage 20per sample per locusto ensure the quality of variant calling,
 - strand bias from the alignment procedure.
