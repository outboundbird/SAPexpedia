## Hierarchical clustering

The hierarchical clustering method will be applied to the Î”X matrix to examine the pattern of changes over the observation period. Specifically, the neuromarkers will be in the rows and the value of changes at each visit will be in the columns. The clustering algorithm will be applied to the neuromarkers to examine if any group of markers evolves along the course of treatment with a similar pattern. A heatmap of the clustering results will be presented. The clustering analysis will be achieved with the R hclust function and the heatmap will be generated with the R pheatmap package.
